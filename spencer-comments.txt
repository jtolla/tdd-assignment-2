Hi, 

Here are some comments in no particular order:

- do not put compiler generated artifacts into source code control.
e.g. .idea directory, out directory. Use .gitignore to help with this. 

- use packages for your classes 

- include the lib directory in your project. 

I should be able to do type the following:

git clone git@github.com:jtolla/tdd-assignment-2.git
cd tdd-assignment-2
ant test

and see:

Build success

right now I see:

 /Users/spencermarks/local-dev/uml/jtolla/tdd-assignment-2/lib does not exist.

 When I fix that, I still see a test failure:

The good parts:

This is a good initial effort. 
While the name 'File' wasn't great, I like the direction you where going. I think 
you where heading towards a class that 'Wrapped' (or contained) a JDK File object
but provided additional functionality for it. That's good. 

In general your documentation was good and your code was easy to follow - both really important. 

I'd be happy to have a one on one chat with you someitme to review your project code and offer more suggestions.
